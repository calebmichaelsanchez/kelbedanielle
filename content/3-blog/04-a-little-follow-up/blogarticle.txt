Title: A Little Follow Up

Text: Since writing my last post on the subject of surrender, I have been constantly thinking of one of my favorite passages and how perfectly it articulates what I was trying to say, so I thought I’d do a little follow-up.  Wendell Berry is one of my favorite authors, and his novel Jayber Crow has been such a powerful, peaceful, and spiritual reading experience for me, and continues to bring both simple and profound truths into my life, such as this one:

>“This, I thought, is what is meant by ‘thy will be done’ in the Lord’s Prayer, which I had prayed time and again without thinking about it. It means that your will and God’s will may not be the same. It means there’s a good possibility that you won’t get what you pray for. It means that in spite of your prayers you are going to suffer. It means you may be crucified….But now I was unsure what it would be proper to pray for, or how to pray for it. After you have said, ‘thy will be done,’ what more can be said? And where do you find the strength to pray ‘thy will be done’ after you see what it means?”
(Jayber Crow, p.51)

As I re-read this passage this morning, I was struck with how comforting this is.  In the text, Jayber admits that he has trouble with the realization that Jesus’ most fervent prayer was not answered.  That is a difficult thing to accept.  But it also gives me a sense of relief, a feeling of freedom.  If I can accept that my will and God’s will may not be the same, and then step back and pray “thy will be done”, what else is there?

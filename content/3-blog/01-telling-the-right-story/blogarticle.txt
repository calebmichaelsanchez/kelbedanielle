Title: Telling the Right Story

Text: Writing can be so difficult. Writing down your experience makes it feel so permanent, so profound, so real. For the past few months, the part of my brain that processes everything, that deals with emotions, that helps me to express myself in profound, articulate ways, has been basically inactive.  It’s like when I encountered this struggle (which I will be writing about more in future posts) my mind just broke.

It’s taken some time to figure out how to write about what I’ve been through recently.  During this time, after being diagnosed with a confusing and little known autoimmune disease, I searched the Internet for sources that offered support for people dealing with the same thing. I wanted to read someone else’s story and see how they deal with the struggle. I thought it might help me start processing my new life.  I was a little disappointed with what I found. While the Internet is full, and I mean FULL, of recipe blogs for people with a variety of autoimmune diseases, as well as random forums where anyone and everyone feels inclined to share really specific and odd symptoms and seek medical advice from fellow users (which scares me a little…), it is lacking in an honest and open discussion about the reality of this experience. It is also lacking in positivity. Sometimes the vibe I get from other sufferers of chronic illness is a bit hopeless…but that won’t do.  It is easy to forget about the small blessings when going through a particularly dark time, and the past few months really have been the hardest of my life, but over and over again, hope has permeated my experience. And that needs to be shared.

My story is the most powerful thing I have to offer those around me, especially those who are going through something similar, which is why it has become an important priority for me. Sharing a personal experience in the form of written word is also important because it prevents the hardships and victories in our humanity from being lost or forgotten in the shuffle of every-day normalcy. So, I’ve decided to start writing my story.

And if there was one thing I learned from taking two classes with Dr. Baker at Spring Arbor, it is the importance of telling the right story. And reading through Wendell Berry’s Port William series has shown me that the right story may not always be the easiest or the most cheerful, but it is always the one that points to goodness, love, and grace. With that in mind, I hope to continue this blog by telling my story and offering what goodness, love, and grace I have to those who read it.

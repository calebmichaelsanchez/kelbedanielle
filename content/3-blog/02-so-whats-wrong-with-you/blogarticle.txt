Text: Many people are aware of what life has been like for Kyle and I since moving to Utah, generally, but I do get a lot of people asking me for updates and for explanations about what has happened and what my diagnosis is. So here is the obligatory informative post to catch everyone up to speed!

Kyle and I graduated from SAU in May, got married in June, and moved to Utah in July. As if that wasn’t enough craziness, I also became really sick and started having some crazy symptoms during this time. It got really bad, bad enough to go to the hospital, on our first day in Utah. Since that first trip to the ER, life has been a blur of doctor’s appointments, lab work, and a variety of other tests.  After 2 months of not having any answers while being barely able to walk, I was finally diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto’s, and about a week after that, I went to a Faint and Fall Clinic and did some tests that confirmed that I also have POTS.

I will admit that the not knowing, while also barely being married for a month, getting settled in a new state where we knew almost no one, was frightening.  Any one who has experienced a health issue understands that being really sick and not knowing why is an extremely isolating thing to experience.  I am so grateful we have family who were able to make the trip out West to support us during this time. Kyle and I were so blessed by their presence!

Here is some basic information about Hashimoto’s and POTS.

**Hashimoto’s** is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system attacks your thyroid. This leads most doctors to be believed that the thyroid is the problem, making it difficult to understand and diagnose. However, the immune system/gut is the root of the problem, while the thyroid is merely the victim. Unfortunately, the thyroid regulates many of the bodies functions, so when it is being attacked, the entire body is being attacked essentially. As with all autoimmune diseases, Hashimoto’s is a chronic illness, meaning it is a life-long disease that cannot be cured. It can, however, be managed! You can treat the thyroid by taking medicine to help keep your thyroid from going crazy. Most people with Hashimoto’s find the most successful way of managing the disease is by focusing on the immune system and the gut and addressing those issues nutritionally. This basically consists of learning what causes flare-ups and avoiding those things.  A supportive and knowledgeable doctor, one who is willing to address the root cause, is essential for this to happen. Stress is also a huge factor in Hashimoto’s. It is essential to learn to manage stress and anxiety in order to avoid really bad episodes.

A few of the symptoms include: fatigue/sluggishness, brain fog, muscle weakness, increased sensitivity to cold, difficulty sleeping, dry skin, depression and anxiety. It is also not unusual to experience weight issues with an autoimmune disease, whether it is difficulty losing weight or gaining weight.

**POTS** is a weird little syndrome that isn’t very well researched yet. It is a positional syndrome in which your blood pressure is very low and your heart rate increases too much when you change positions, from laying to sitting or sitting to standing. You know that feeling you get when you stand up too quickly and you see stars for a moment? Someone with POTS is likely to feel that continually throughout the day. POTS is diagnosed with a tilt test table, meaning they strap you to a table and raise it to a standing position and keep you there for about 30 minutes while they measure your heart rate and blood pressure. (It’s terrible.) You must fit a certain set of criteria to be diagnosed with POTS, such as your heart rate increasing by 30bpm during this test. Symptoms of POTS include dizziness, fatigue, and weakness, especially in legs, pounding heart, and an inability to stand or walk for long periods of time. POTS can be treated by increasing salt intake, drinking more water, and reconditioning your body to an upright position. This takes time and is very difficult, because in a severe case of POTS, even getting out of bed to go to the bathroom can be extremely challenging and even impossible. Fortunately, my case does not seem to be that bad and has improved over the past few months. I am doing what I can to recover from it. I still find it very difficult to stand in the kitchen and cook dinner many nights. I haven’t been able to go on any hikes yet, but I have been able to go on walks around our neighborhood, which is an incredible improvement from where I was two months ago.

So, what now? It’s going to be a long journey to get back to my “normal” self.  It is going to require a lot of self-care and patience, but I have hope that I will one day be able to recover from POTS and manage my Hashimoto’s enough to live well and pursue an active lifestyle again.
